# Vehicle-Manufacturer-Analysis-Using-Linear-Regression
Analyze vehicle manufacturing data
Use R to design and interpret a multiple linear regression analysis, calculate summary statistics and t-tests, and provide an interpretation of these results. Design statistical study to compare vehicle performance of two vehicles of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.

# Linear Regression to Predict MPG
perform linear regression that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using variables within the MechaCar_mpg.csv file, and then provide a summary of their interpretation of the results.

# Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
create a summary statistics table that has the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for all the manufacturing lots and for each lot's suspension coil’s pounds-per-square inch (PSI) variable, and then provide a summary of their interpretation of the results. 

add the Suspension_Coil.csv file as a data frame, and then use the summarize() function to get the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation on the PSI column.

calculate the total summary statistics on the PSI column for each Manufacturing lot. First, they'll need to use the group_by() function to create a table with the each lot, and use the summarize() function to get the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of the suspension coil’s PSI as the columns for each lot.

# T-Tests on Suspension Coils
perform a t-test to to determine if all Manufacturing lots and each lot are statistically different from the mean population results of 1,500 pounds per square inch, and then provide a summary of their interpretation of the results.

write a t-test using the t.test() function to determine the if the PSI for all Manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

perform three separate t-test on a "subset" of the data, which are the three manufacturing lots. For this part of the deliverable we have provided a Hint for the students to help them determine how to writer their RScript.

# Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.

## Analysis.txt explanation

1. What is the metric or metrics you are going to test?
2. What is the null and alternative hypothesis?
3. What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
4. What data is needed to run the statistical test?
